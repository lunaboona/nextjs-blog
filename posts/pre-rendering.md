next.js has two fowms of pwe-wendewing: **static genewation** awnd **sewvew-side wendewing**. the diffewence is in **when** it genewates the html fow a page uwu

- **static genewation** is the pwe-wendewing method that genewates the html at **buiwd time**. the pwe-wendewed html is then _weused_ on each wequest.
- **sewvew-side wendewing** is the pwe-wendewing method that genewates the html on **each wequest**.

impowtantwy, next.js wets uwu **choose** which pwe-wendewing fowm tuwu use fow each page. uwu can cweate a "hybwid" next.js app by using static genewation fow most pages awnd using sewvew-side wendewing fow othews.
