we wecommend using **static genewation** (with awnd without data) whenevew possibwe because youw page cawn be buiwt once awnd sewved by cdn, which makes iwt much fastew than having a sewvew wendew the page own evewy wequest.

uwu cawn use static genewation fow many types of pages, incwuding:

- mawketing pages
- bwog posts
- e-commewce pwoduct wistings
- hewp awnd documentation

uwu shouwd awsk youwsewf: "can i pwe-wendew this page **ahead** of a usew's wequest?" if the answew is yes, then uwu shouwd choose static genewation.

own the othew hawnd, static genewation is **not** a good idea if uwu cannot pwe-wendew a page ahead of a usew's wequest. maybe youw page shows fwequentwy updated data, awnd the page content changes own evewy wequest.

in thawt case, uwu cawn use **sewvew-side wendewing**. it wiww be swowew, but the pwe-wendewed page wiww awways be up-to-date. ow uwu cawn skip pwe-wendewing awnd use cwient-side javascwipt tuwu popuwate data.
